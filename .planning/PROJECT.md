# Prefect

## What This Is

A TypeScript MCP server that exposes OpenCode's headless HTTP API as Claude Code tools. Claude Code orchestrates at the task/spec level (decompose, review, correct) while delegating actual file edits to a local model (Qwen or similar) running in OpenCode. The result lands in git history; Claude Code sees diffs and runs tests independently.

## Current Milestone: v3.0 Daily Driver

**Goal:** Make Prefect meaningfully better for daily use — infrastructure fixes, high-leverage workflow shortcuts, semantic tooling, and proper distribution.

**Target features:**
- Infrastructure: directory param on all tools, `OPENCODE_DEFAULT_PROJECT` env var, auto-start opencode serve
- Workflow shortcuts: `opencode_delegate`, `opencode_dispatch`, `opencode_inspect`, `opencode_await`
- npm distribution: npm publish + `npm install -g` pathway
- `GET /agent` — list available agents
- `GET /provider` — list configured providers and models
- `GET /find/symbol` — LSP-backed workspace symbol search

## Core Value

Claude Code can delegate implementation to a local model and review/correct the results without leaving the Claude Code workflow.

## Requirements

### Validated (v1.0)

- ✓ MCP server with 7 OpenCode tools: opencode_create_session, opencode_run, opencode_get_diff, opencode_approve_permission, opencode_fork, opencode_revert, opencode_abort — v1.0
- ✓ All tools wrap OpenCode's HTTP API (OPENCODE_URL configurable, default http://localhost:4096) — v1.0
- ✓ opencode_run blocks via Promise.race with PREFECT_TIMEOUT_MS (120s default) — v1.0
- ✓ Project-scoped MCP registration via `.mcp.json` (type: stdio, command: node, args: build/index.js) — v1.0
- ✓ CLAUDE.md documents the canonical create→run→diff→test→correct loop with all 7 tools — v1.0
- ✓ README.md with full fresh-clone setup guide (install, build, configure OpenCode, serve, wire) — v1.0
- ✓ examples/test-task.md end-to-end validation prompt producing a real file diff — v1.0

### Validated (v2.0)

- ✓ opencode_session_command — POST /session/:id/command for slash command execution — v2.0


### Active (v3.0 targets)

- [ ] directory param on all tools (currently only on opencode_create_session)
- [ ] **INFRA-XX**: `OPENCODE_DEFAULT_PROJECT` env var — fallback directory resolution order: per-tool `directory` param → `OPENCODE_DEFAULT_PROJECT` → `process.cwd()`. Documented in README and `.mcp.json` env table. Implement in the same plan as directory-param propagation.
- [ ] auto-start opencode serve if not running (currently a manual prerequisite)
- [ ] opencode_delegate — blocking create+run+diff in one call (WORKFLOW-01)
- [ ] opencode_dispatch — non-blocking fire-and-forget create+prompt_async (WORKFLOW-02)
- [ ] opencode_inspect — compact progress snapshot: status+todo+changed files (WORKFLOW-03)
- [ ] opencode_await — poll a dispatch session to completion, return full result (WORKFLOW-04)
- [ ] npm publish + npm install -g prefect-mcp install pathway
- [ ] GET /agent — list available agents
- [ ] GET /provider — list configured providers and models
- [ ] GET /find/symbol — LSP-backed workspace symbol search

### Active (v4.0 targets)

- [ ] opencode_run tools override (enable/disable per prompt)
- [ ] opencode_run FilePartInput (file attachments as context)
- [ ] opencode_run messageID (resume from specific message)
- [ ] opencode_run AgentPartInput / SubtaskPartInput
- [ ] opencode_create_session parentID (session hierarchies)
- [ ] session.summarize — POST /session/:id/summarize
- [ ] session.todo — GET /session/:id/todo
- [ ] session.init — POST /session/:id/init (generate AGENTS.md)
- [ ] session.shell — POST /session/:id/shell
- [ ] session.share / session.unshare — POST+DELETE /session/:id/share
- [ ] GET /vcs — structured VCS info
- [ ] GET /file/status — structured git-tracked file status
- [ ] GET /mcp + POST /mcp — inspect and inject MCP servers
- [ ] GET /experimental/tool/ids + GET /experimental/tool — inspect available tools per model

### Out of Scope

- Multi-user or team npm registry — npm publish is in scope but scoped to single-developer install
- Permission loop (SSE + concurrent HTTP) — OpenCode auto-approves trusted ops; git is the safety net
- Multi-user or team config — single machine, single developer

## Context

- OpenCode runs headless: `opencode serve --port 4096`
- OpenCode config sets model to local Qwen (Ollama/llama.cpp) and auto-approves file write/delete
- Claude Code acts as orchestrator: it reads specs, decomposes phases, sends prompts to opencode_run, reviews diffs, runs tests via bash, and sends corrections if needed
- If a session gets corrupted, opencode_fork at the last good message provides an escape hatch
- The MCP SDK is `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`; transport is StdioServerTransport (Claude Code spawns the server as a subprocess)
- Shipped v1.0 with 201 LOC TypeScript, 46 commits
- Shipped v2.0 with 1,221 LOC TypeScript, 69 commits — 18 tools total (up from 7)

## Constraints

- **Language**: TypeScript — MCP SDK is idiomatic TS, already have a ~200-line reference implementation
- **Runtime**: Node.js — MCP server runs as a stdio subprocess spawned by Claude Code
- **Scope**: Personal use only — no auth, no multi-tenant concerns, no npm publish pipeline
- **OpenCode API**: HTTP only — SSE-based permission loop deliberately out of scope

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Auto-approve OpenCode permissions | Git is the safety net; permission loop (SSE + blocking HTTP on same session) adds complexity without proportional value | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| OPENCODE_URL env var, default http://localhost:4096 | Easy to override without touching code; personal use means one config | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| opencode_run blocks via Promise.race with PREFECT_TIMEOUT_MS | Simpler than AbortController for v1; upgraded to AbortController in v2.0 | ✓ Validated v1.0; superseded v2.0 |
| StdioServerTransport + .mcp.json project-scope | Claude Code spawns MCP servers as subprocesses via stdio; .mcp.json ensures all clones get it without manual claude mcp add | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| Permission response enum: once/always/reject | REQUIREMENTS.md originally said allow/deny/allow_always — confirmed from @opencode-ai/sdk types | ✓ Validated v1.0 |
| AbortController replaces Promise.race for opencode_run timeout | Cancels in-flight TCP connection on abort; Promise.race orphaned the HTTP request | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| opencode_prompt_async is a separate endpoint, not noReply | POST /session/:id/prompt_async returns 204 void; noReply on the sync prompt endpoint is a different concept | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| SURF-02 discriminators verified from SDK types before writing Zod schemas | Getting Part type literals wrong is the same bug class as the v1.0 permission enum error | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| CLI in separate src/cli.ts compiling to build/cli.js | Avoids coupling MCP server stdio startup with CLI argument parsing | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| Manual process.argv parsing over Commander.js | One subcommand, one flag — zero additional deps justified | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
| model field on opencode_session_command is z.string(), not z.object() | session.command endpoint takes a single string, not a providerID+modelID object | ✓ Validated v2.0 |
